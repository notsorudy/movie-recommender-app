# Movie Recommender System
In this project, first we use the TMDB reviews dataset from Kaggle to pre-process the data and use cosine similarity to identify the top 5 most recommended movies
based on the highest score. We also display the results inclusing the movie posters in the form of a streamlit web app.

## How to Use this Model?

### 1. Run the .ipynb file :
Run the file and extract similarity.pkl and movies_dict.pkl files in your computer.

### 2. Run the app.py file :
First, set up the environment and download all dependencies using requirements.txt. Then,
run the app1.py file in a folder that contains both the pickle files and you can use the the movie recommender!
